<p class="regularArticle">我叫保珍，現住西雅圖， 我媽媽今年96歲，大約10年前做了腸癌手術。醫生建議做化療， 由於媽媽體質虛弱沒有接受醫生建議。參照網上提示戒甜，戒煙，戒補，戒煎炸及高溫食物，不能吃飽加上每天飲半杯綠豆水，這樣平安地度過7，8 年。中途身體出現痛症主要是大便不通引致，最近幾年以粥食爲主少吃飯。每當她吃多體重增加，痛症又回來。</p>
<p class="regularArticle">約在2016年7月份媽媽的痛症又發作，以往是股部及腹部内痛，今次是骨痛且吃了强力止痛藥也起不了多大功效，以往痛1，2個月慢慢就回復正常。今次是日益嚴重，老人院懷疑她癌症擴散至骨頭。她老人家不願作任何檢查或治療。我們很擔心，媽媽每日痛苦難熬。幸好，于2016年9月份留意到廖學時博士研發的”Allesgen”。 在無任何良藥下嘗試訂購了2瓶。在半信半疑的狀況下吃了2個星期后媽媽的痛苦叫聲減少了，我們很開心，感覺媽媽有救了！這樣她保持每天吃“Allesgen”至2017年4月份，她已回復正常。感謝廖博士，廖太太的幫助及偉大研發救了我媽媽！！</p>
<p class="regularArticle">本人在2017年中開始感覺食道上有像痰的東西增長。過了一，二個月仍在慢慢長大，後來側睡也感覺到它觸到食道内的另一邊，引起無故的咳嗽。心里有點慌，我沒有勇氣看醫生檢查，我也開始每天食用。今天那可怕的食道瘤縮小到幾乎忘記了它的存在。每當我多吃甜食時它似乎又在增長。例如1/3碗紅棗，大口吃西瓜，木薯等。現在我除了食用“Allesgen”，在日常的飲食也要戒口配合。</p>
<p class="regularArticle">朋友提醒我,很多都市病都是“食”出來的包括痛風，高血壓，腫瘤癌症。若要成功脫離這些病痛，也必須戒口，保持健康飲食，偏素食，每天衹吃7成飽，少吃海鮮，對不健康的美食衹能淺嘗這樣可降低疾病的侵襲，但若全素食也非健康之道，會使所需養分失去平衡。</p>
<p class="regularArticle">再次感謝廖博士，廖太太的幫助及偉大研發，如果能改變爲偏素食的健康食療加上“Allesgen”的治療相信癌症無法在你身體内壯大生存，祝各位身體健康，新年快樂！</p>

<p class="regularArticle">Dear Dr. Liao and Mrs. Liao<br/>
I am BoZhen in Seattle.  My mum is 96 years old.  About 10 years ago my mom got a serious operation for the bowel cancer.  The doctor suggested her take the chemical therapy but my mom is too weak to take any further treatment so she didn’t do any follow up treatment.   Learning from the internet advise that sugar, milk products or any tonic food, fried food, baked food,  would help cancer grow or spread faster.  To stay healthy and minimized the burden of bowel better eat 70% of full.   My mom keeps on drink half cup of Mung bean soup every day that helps for the Detoxification.  It is lucky that she is ok for the last 8 years.  However in between she got back and stomach ache whenever she has constipation issue.  So for the last few years her recipe is congee and less rice.  Whenever her appetite being good and gain weight then she got the pain again.  The pain was stomachache and groin.
<br/>
In 2016 July mom got the pain again however this time was bone pain not like before.  Even she took strong painkiller she can’t stop crying due to the deeply pain.  Before her pain will be gone within 2 months but this time getting worse.   The nurse at the nursing home said her cancer may diffusion at bone.  My mom doesn’t want to do any treatment or checking which make her feel uncomfortable.   We were so worry about my mom’s Health status.  It is lucky that in 2016 Sept., we found the supplement named ”Allegen” which developed by Dr. Liao.   It said all natural and no side effect at all furthermore the result will be tell within a certain period of time not endless ongoing take.  Since there is no other positive option and I ordered 2 as trying for mom.  After 2 weeks my mom’ pain being less and I am so excited that it works on her.  She kept on taking it daily and after 7 months period she back to normal.  We highly appreciate the team of Dr. Liao had develop such great supplement that save my mom’s life.  Mrs. Liao helps us for the guidance of taking the supplement.
<br/>
In mid of 2017 I felt my esophagus got something like sputum however it grows daily.  About few months later it was getting bigger.  When I was sleep I felt it touching the other side of my esophagus that made me coughing without any reason.  I was so scared and dare not to do any checkup.  I was thinking that “Allesgen” can rescue my mom and I would like to try it as well.  At the beginning I was taking 2pcs each after breakfast and dinner meal.  About 2 weeks later my coughing stopped.  Now I almost forget about that tumor.  However when I eat quite some of sweets like date soup, water melon, Cassava etc…I can feel it grows again.  Now other than the “Allesgen” help I have to be careful on healthy food selection.
<br/>
Friends remind me that quite some of the sickness is from junk food including Gout, High blood pressure, Tumor, Cancer etc….  If need to get rid of the disease, healthy food selection is very important.  Stay healthy recipes, less meat and eat 80% full or less. Less sea food etc… for good taste food just try a little bit but not too much.  This way will help to keep away from disease or stop diffusion.  Vegetarian is not really healthy for long term as it can’t be fulfill the nutrition need as well as may lost the nutrition balance.
<br/>
Again I would like to say thank you to Dr. Liao and Mrs. Liao for such great creation/develop of this supplement.  If people can change the unhealthy custom and being less meat with ”Allegen” help any cancer won’t be survive or diffusion in the body.
<br/>
Stay healthy and Happy New Year !!
<br/>
Healthy tips sharing:  take 4 or 5 pieces of raw fresh garlic mud and mix with food daily will help the prevention of flu or get recover soon.
