        幾年後,身體健康檢查又發現乳房也長了腫瘤, 開刀後乳癌與子宮體癌的癌細胞是不同的,還是繼續使用雷錠, 但是都沒有明顯的改善, 癌細胞還是持續擴散, 廖醫師難過地跟我說,只能再多活3個月, 我聽了非常傷心又絕望, 我知道廖醫師是癌症專家,有近30年的婦癌手術經驗, 連他都沒有法治療我, 我不知還有什麼方法能解決我的病症.
        有天廖醫師在例行檢查時告訴我, 他研發了一個新的抗癌產品, 問我要不要試試看, 我當然一口答應, 每天照著他指示吃這唯一的希望, 吃了一個月之後, 我已不再流血, 服用六個月後,再去做一次身體檢查, 發現癌細胞居然都消失了, 報告中已無發現任何癌細胞, 但我還是每2個月持續追蹤, 到現在過了六年半, 我的生活已和正常人一樣, 健康快樂, 行動自如, 不用再擔心癌細胞擴散.
        廖醫師真是我最偉大的救命恩人, 他為人親切負責, 對於癌症或癌末病患, 從不輕言放棄, 再棘手的問題, 他都會想辦法解決, 也會替病人著想, 減輕病人痛苦, 真是一個難得的好醫生。"

        Allesgen不是仙丹, 不是吃下去, 馬上就能看到效果的, 至少需要吃了1~2個月, 才能感覺到身體上的好轉, 但效果也是因人而異, 有些人吃了一個月, 就有很明顯的改善, 有些人需要吃半年. 雖然藥效不快, 但是對於癌細胞是有很明顯的效果。 
        2個星期前, 我去照了CT SCAN, 發現肺部的腫瘤縮小了很多, 而我只吃了三個半月就有這樣的效果, 真的非常高興, 會繼續向廖醫師買Allesgen來吃, 真心期待癌細胞完全消失的那天來臨!!!"

        My aunt and uncle who live in Baltimore, Maryland have owned a smoke-related family business for the past ten years and it wasn't until recently that they both discovered that they both suffered from lung cancer: my uncle had squamous cell cancer and my aunt had glandular cancer. Both of them went to John Hopkins Hospital seeking treatment, but the oncologists at the hospital said they were not treatable since both of them were in their late 4th stage with multiple organ system spread and metastasis. My uncle went through several courses of chemotherapy, but due to severe side effects of bone marrow suppression, he was not able to continue with his chemotherapy treatment. 
        Just when they were almost giving up, my family and I came across information concerning the medicine, Allesgen, online. We thought that it was worth a try and we told my uncle and aunt about it. They went to Dr. Benedict Liao for help and after 4~6 Allesgen pills a day for 6~7 months, they are now cancer free. The follow up CT scan and PET scan both show no evidence of persistent disease. 
        I strongly recommend Allesgen for all cancer patients.You may call or visit Dr. Liao for any cancer and treatment related question. He always has the time to discuss it with you. A big thank you from me and my family, Dr. Liao!"

The tumor is huge: approximately 15*10*15cm, and the oncologist cannot cure him. He then went to USC Norris Cancer Center for a second opinion. After going through a course of Chemo-embolization, he had severe bone marrow suppression and sepsis; he was then treated in ICU intensive care for one month. 
        Our family friend heard of Dr. Benedict Liao with his Allesgen treatment, so he recommend we pay a visit to his older office in Monterey Park, CA (they relocate the office to a West Covina, CA). 
        After a one month Allesgen treatment with 6 tablets a day, my father’s jaundice and severe pain subsided. The metastasis on the lung, bone, spine and pelvic all disappeared after 4 months of Allesgen treatment! We were surprise to see the result in his CT/PET scan. We continue with the treatment for 3 more months and my father’s tumor became liquefied. He went back to hospital for drainage and biopsies after and the tumor was no longer there. 
        A year later, my mother suffered from Lymphoma and had left neck and intra-abdominal spread. With our previous experience with Dr. Liao, we went back to Dr. Liao at his new office in West Covina (CA) for his Allesgen treatment. 
        After 5 months, all tumors and metastasis disappeared and blood tests were back to normal again. The following CT scan and PET scan showed no persistent tumors. I strongly recommend Allesgen for anyone who has or whose family has been diagnosed with Cancer."

In April the cancer had metastasized to my bladder and the tumors were excised. In June, the surgeon examined the bladder and found that the first seven tumors were successfully removed. I had six weeks of BCG Liver treatments and at the end of that six weeks, the doctors found another twelve tumors. The therapy was a total failure. Prior to the last therapy, I told the surgeon, \"If this doesn't work, I am going to China for alternative treatments\"; and he said, \"I don't blame you.\" 
        But truly, I was giving up, until I researched Yelp and saw a few reviews on this supplement that works. I contacted Dr. Liao and he gave me a world of information regarding the various options I can choose to do rather than forcing me to do things. I was especially interested in the 25 pages of testimonials of his patients. I found the clinic to be immaculate, the technicians very pleasant and professional, the doctor was very informative and professional, with the latest diagnostic equipment. 
        After stocking up on three bottles of Allesgen supplements, I suddenly felt more alive. There were times that I felt weak and couldnt eat but that was the beginning of the process. i was already weak before taking the supplements. i have to say that you have to be patient because this supplement does cure you within a week. it takes time like 3-7 months or longer. BUT the supplements do cure the cancer! I came back to Dr. Liao's clinic a year later to show him my results on a CD. I showed him how the tumor massively decreased each month. Guess what readers? There's no such thing as kidney cancer nor bladder cancer in my dictionary. 
        I thank God for Dr. Liao for giving me such hope and for his intelligence for creating such an amazing supplement. I feel that with my present remission I will be cancer free for the remainder of my life."

        After five months of taking the pills, my mom's cancer shrunk to 2.3 cm!  Two months later, it was basically gone. Even the other doctors whom I visited again were shocked at the result. I thought it was impossible, but it really happened and I seriously can not thank Dr. Liao enough. I would recommend this treatment to anyone."

        "content"=>"I have to  disagree with the previous review because I thought the doctor was pretty professional. At times, he does make jokes to ease the tension of the topic. I started off calling him since I live many miles away. He answered most of my questions about his cancer treatment called Allesgen. The price is a bit high , but I think it is way cheaper than chemotherapy and other \"cancer treatments\". 
        After taking Allesgen for a couple of months, I have decided to meet this doctor in person. I flew down to see him in his clinic and to talk more about my breast cancer. (no shame of talking about my disease) Awhile back, my personal doctor had told me about my breast cancer. On top of that, I had a hip fracture. He said that I will have a slight chance of surviving only because the tumor was spreading quickly and that I was already weak due to my fracture. Even with chemo, I was feeling fatigue and weak. Fast forward 5 months later , after taking Allesgen, I did feel a little better. I have noticed that my hair grew back a bit. My CT scans looked a lot better. My CT and PET scans have improved a lot over the past months after I have received the first result. 
        I am still taking Allesgen till this day and I say, whoever wants to have a higher chance of survival, I say, give this man a chance and see what Allesgen treatment can do for you. Everyone's case is different, so I cannot say that your result is as fast as mine. But give it a shot. Go to his clinic and remember to bring all your report. That way, he can make a better decision and tell you what you should do and etc."

I went to the doctor to have a body check-up and found out from my CT scan result that I had an advanced stage of breast cancer. I was shocked at the results. The breast cancer tumors had spread to my spines and my oncologists said they could not treat me because i was in the late 4th stage of cancer.
        I saw Dr. Benedict Liao's advertisement on internet and I decided to pay a visit to his office for a consultation. Dr. Liao was really friendly and helpful, despite my endless barrage of questions. I started taking 4 tablets a day and after 4 months of taking Dr. Liao's treatment Allesgen, my CT scan results showed great improvement. The lumbar spine metastasis disappeared, but some remaining cervical spine lesions still bothered me so I continue to take Allesgen. After six more months, all of my annoying symptoms were gone. I no longer felt the numbness and pain I used to feel on my limbs. My CT scans also showed minimal cervical spine persistent disease.
        I'm still currently taking Allesgen and I can't wait to see the good news on my future scan results!"

I went on his website to read the information he provided and decided to schedule a consultation.

I bought his supplements from him and it worked! It's been six months, my navel looks great, I feel fantastic, and Dr. Liao still continues to monitor my progress!

        "content"=>"I love all the staff I have encountered at this clinic. From the first encounter with any of the receptionists, to the expert laboratory staff, warm nurses and the physician I see that it's obvious these people are in healthcare for the people. I've never been waiting too long, the lobby is warm and inviting, with lovely decorations to make it feel like you're in a cozy place. The doctor has never kept me waiting and always explained all the tests and such in great detail (and in words that  a normal person can understand.) Scheduling appointments is easy, the office is efficient, and the staff is great. What more can you want (other than a CURE for cancer) Oh wait, I can answer the last part. Dr. Liao came up with this supplement. I went through his website to read about: what its made of, how it works, and previous survivors. To be honest, there's nothing good on Yelp for him and I don't know why. But I do know that it is because most of his patients are old and doesnt even know how to work a computer. I bet you all that if these old patients can type, I bet you Dr. Liao would get 5 stars no doubt.
        Anyway, I have to admit that I have breast cancer. What can I do but to chop that devilish thing off me? And that was what I did a few years ago. Guess what? The most haunting thing came back. I didnt know what to do until I met Dr. Liao. We discussed about the supplement and how it can help me. Being the desperate person I am, I bought it. Being skeptic and scared of being scammed, I only bought one bottle.  It was risky because theres not such thing as a cure for cancer right? That was when eveything changes. WIthin a month, my other oncologist from LA, was shocked that my tumor size was decreasing massively. That was when i went back to buy 2 more bottles to completely kill that last cancer cell! Guess what? I am a happy survivor! No more tumor. I wish people from all the breast cancer foudnation can read about this and come here for treatment. You will not regret it.

We discussed options and even listed out all the risks of a lumpectomy surgery, which I really appreciated. Then wed discussed about the supplements, the procedures and possible results. About six months later, all the hospital staff were raving about how fast fast my tumor died down in sizes and how fast i was recovering. It's true.
        When I went in for my post op, she was pretty quick and answered all my questions. I had a really, really good experience with her and would definitely recommend her if anyone needs to see a doctor about their ta-tas. Their office staff is definitely on the ball as well and very quick to respond."

We were recommended by a friend to see Dr. Liao, who invented a cancer medicine which was what saved my friend. We were curious and skeptic at first so I set up a meeting with the doctor. Dr. Liao was very patient with us answering all our questions. He spent over an hour going through my mom's medical records and how the medicine will effect my mom. For a patient in  her late cancer stage, this is her only ounce of hope. With the push from friend and the result comparisions shown to us from previous cancer patients, my mom decided to give this medicine a try.
        In the first 3 weeks, I can see drastic change in my mom's mood. She had less difficulty breathing and her chest and bone aches began to decrease. We were afraid it was a placebo effect and on the third month I took her to get a CT and PET SCAN. The results were unbelievable. Her cancer cell reduced by 70% and even the CT techinican couldn't believe their eyes. My mom is still following up with Dr. Liao and we are truely thankful for his discovery.
        I really want to recommend this doctor and the medicine to everyone, because it is the real thing."
